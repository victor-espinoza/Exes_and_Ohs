Project Overview:

A text-based Tic-Tac-Toe Game using C++.

This project is very simple. The first step is to create the Tic-Tac-Toe gameboard. For this implementation I decided to use a 2-dimensional array of characters (3x3). Each element in the array represents a space on the Tic-Tac-Toe gameboard. I then displayed the gameboard to show that all of the spaces on it were available to choose. After that I prompted the player to input a valid move. Once a valid move was given, I then updated the 2-dimensional array with the appropriate value depending on whether the player was X (1) or O (-1).

After doing this I then checked to see if the move resulted in a victory for either player. If this was the case, then the winner was immediately displayed. If not, I then switched the turn to the other player and repeated the same process for their move. This continues until either a person wins the game or all of the spaces on the gameboard are taken (which results in a tie). Once the game finishes, the results are shown on the console window and the program is terminated. That is how this projec works.
